	<!-- Read through the gclass Workshop description for a broad understanding of what CSS is.
	Very briefly, CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
	CSS describes the appearance of a webpage.
	You can adjust fonts, sizes, colors, and more.

	<!-- 
	Usually CSS is done through an external CSS file.
	When we say "inline CSS", we mean that you write CSS code here, in an HTML file, inline with the HTML code.

	<!-- For this image, we use the style to specify the height and width to 500, and we also modify the border radius to give the image rounded corners.
	You can see that:
		- Properties are highlighted in blue
		- Values are highlighted in purple
		- Units are highlighted in red
	The properties we modify in the image below are:
		- border-radius
		- width
		- height
	While the values we set them to are (in order):
		- 25 pixels rounded
		- 500 pixels wide
		- 500 pixels tall
