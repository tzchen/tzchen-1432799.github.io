	<h2>My Favorite Sites</h2>
		<!-- The <ol> tag represents an "ordered list". Lists are ALWAYS made up of "list items", which are held by <li> tags.
		In an ordered list, list items are numbered. In an unordered list, represented by a <ul> tag, list items are bulleted. -->
		<ol>
			<li>
			<!-- The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The white text between the opening and closing tag is what actually shows up in the page. -->

	<h2>My Favorite Pictures</h2>
		<!-- 
		<img> tags hold images. 
		The "title" is a quick description of what the image shows.
		The "style" defines certain attributes to adjust the appearance of the image. -->

		<!-- 
		The first <img> tag is surrounded by an <a> tag. 
		This makes the image itself become a link. 
		The "style" of the image here makes the image 100 pixels wide, 100 pixels tall, and gives it a margin of 5 pixels. 
		-->

		<!-- 
		The second <img> tag is also surrounded by an <a> tag. 
		Since it doesn't have "style" attributes, the size and appearance of the image is the same as the original source image.
